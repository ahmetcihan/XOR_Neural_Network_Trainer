##Requirements:

    C++ compiler
    Qt Creator IDE
    Qt framework (version 5.x)

##Key Features:

    Implements a single-layer Perceptron neural network without external libraries
    Trains the network on the XOR problem dataset using custom math functions
    Calculates and displays the training error
    Focuses on understanding the fundamental principles of neural networks
